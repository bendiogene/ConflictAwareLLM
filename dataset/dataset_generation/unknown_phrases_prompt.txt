The following is the prompt used to generate the `unknown_phrases.json` from the questions.txt. 

Starting from this list of facts, can you create one data entry for each that concerns imaginary names and characters if necessary, while following the same logic. 

For example,  Danielle Darrieux's mother tongue is French => Becomes Machin De Machine's mother tongue is Kurdi (or Kinduli). 
Edwin of Northumbria's religious values strongly emphasize Christianity => Hamed Habib's religious values strongly emphasize Atheism (or Peace or..)
Try to make the old and new as far as possible from each other (e.g. kurdi is far from French, Kinduli is an imaginary language etc), while keeping some logic. 
Write in json please (easy to parse)
